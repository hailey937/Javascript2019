- An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does

1. Event = onClick() - the user clicks an HTML element (ex. button)
2. Code => Change the text inside the <p> tag
    document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = 'Help Came!'

    document => Refers to the web page
    getElementById() => Access a specific HTML item by ID
    innerHTML => Access the text between two like tags

- Javascript code must be inserted in <script> tags
-A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for;
  - A function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button

- An alert box (popup box) is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user
   - You would need to create a function, then add alert("add text");

- var: variable (variables are containers for storing data values)
- parseInt: turns strings into integers/numbers
- onmouseover: The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
- onmouseout: The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element

- Swapping: back and forth between things (ex. images)
- src: source
- Strings: letters/words
